# DATACOM_APT34
Used OSINT tools and techniques to gather information on APT34. Applied MITRE ATT&CK Framework to identify & categorize cyber threats, and to develop a comprehensive defense strategy to protect the client's networks and systems against future attacks. 

### What is their history?
Helix Kitten (also known as APT34 by FireEye, OILRIG, Crambus, Cobalt, Gypsy, Hazel Sandstrom, or Europium) is a cyber espionage group. It was first identified in 2014. They are known for targeting various industries and have been linked to numerous cyberattacks, particularly in the Middle East. APT34 is known as sophisticated and persistent attacks, often using social engineering tactics to gain initial access to targeted systems.

### Which nation/state are they associated with?
APT34 is widely believed to be associated with the Iranian government. Cybersecurity researchers and intelligence agencies have linked their activities to Iran, suggesting that the group operates in support of Iranian national interests.

### Do they target specific industries?
APT34 targets specific industries, particularly those that align with Iran's strategic interests:
- Energy (especially oil & gas)
- Financial Services
- Telecommunications
- Government & Defense
- Critical Infrastructure
- Engineering & Construction

### What are their motives?
APT34's primary motives are cyber espionage & intelligence gathering. Their activities often involve stealing sensitive information, intellectual property, and strategic data from targeted organizations. These efforts are typically in line with Iran's geopolitical interests, such as gaining intelligence on rival nations, supporting state-sponsored operations, and advancing national capabilities in critical industries.

### What are the TTPs they use to conduct their attacks?
APT34 is known for employing a wide range of Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures (TTPs) to conduct their attacks, including:
- ***Phishing & Social Engineering:*** They often use spear-phishing emails to trick individuals into downloading malware or providing credentials.
- ***Custom Malware:*** APT34 has developed and deployed various custom malware tools such as *POISONFANG, Caterpillar Webshell, and TwoFace.*
- ***Credential Harvesting:*** They focus on stealing login credentials through phishing, keylogging, and other methods.
- ***Web Shells:*** They deploy web shells to maintain persistence and control over compromised web servers.
- ***Exploitation of Vulnerabilities:*** APT34 is known to exploit unpatched vulnerabilities in software and systems to gain initial access and escalate privileges.
- ***Command and Control (C2) Infrastructure:*** They use various C2 servers to maintain communication with compromised systems, often employing encryption to evade detection.

### What security measures could the client implement to defend against cyberattacks conducted by this APT?
To defend against cyberattacks conducted by APT34, organizations should consider implementing the following security measures:
- Security awareness training to help employees recognize phishing attempts and social engineering tactics.
- Implementing *Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)* to add an additional layer of security to the login process, reducing the effectiveness of credential harvesting.
- Regularly update and patch systems to fix vulnerabilities that APT34 could exploit.
- Implement network segmentation to limit the lateral movement of attackers within the network.
- Use *Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR)* solutions to detect and respond to malicious activities on endpoints.
- Deploy *Web Application Firewalls (WAFs)* to protect web applications from web-shell attacks and other web-based threats.
- Conduct regular security audits and penetration testing to identify and remediate potential vulnerabilities.
- Utilize threat intelligence feeds to stay informed about the latest tactics and indicators of compromise associated with APT34.
